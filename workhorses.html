        Where governments assert their authority and turn their plethora of
        citizens into workhorses and commodities they can profit off of. In the
        guise of national responsibility, the ‘culture’ or competitive
        reputation Asian individuals have to maintain.

        All the decor and all the glitz and glam of the city can be attributed
        to the lack of citizen informed democracy. The authoritative
        parliamentary system asserts itself as the dominating force maintaining
        its managerial status. Control the government has over the cities and
        the drive to be so 'futuristic' as a means to establish themselves in
        global politics as a powerhouse, despite the size of the country.
